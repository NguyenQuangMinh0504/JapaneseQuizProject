Discription
===========

This program make random quiz to remember
japanese words from book mimikara oboeru
faster. I developed this program while stuying Japanese because I found that remembering kanji word in the book is tough and I though it would be great to have a program that shuffle the kanji word and check if i can remember them correctly.

I developed this when I was young and stupid so the code is messy.
